## How to export txt file ##

On the Whatsapp mobile app, go to Settings > Chats > Chat history > Export chat.
Then choose the chat that you wish to export, you will then get a prompt to 
either export "without media" or "include media", if you don't have plans for
the media I recommend exporting the chats without it since it's smaller.
From their you can choose whatever option to send the file to yourself!
