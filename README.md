# whatsapp_chat_analysis

I started this project for fun to learn programming in python. I figured analyzing personal chats would be an interesting way to learn python and more about myself. I could not have done this without the help of AI, so I will revisit this once I finish my coursework and am more knowledgeable! 

Current programs:

-text_replacement.py - This program will let you change a line of text, frankly unnecessary since most text editors have that built in functionality.

-frequency_histogram.py - This will plot a histogram of the frequency of text per day over time.

-frequency_trendline.py - This will plot a trend line of the frequency of text per day over time.

planned programs:
-plot character length of messages over time

-plot emoji use over time

-most used words/phrases

-Using HMM, see if there is a relation between emotional response and volume of messages sent/length of message.
